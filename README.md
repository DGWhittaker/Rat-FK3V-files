# Rat-FK3V-files
This repository consists of two folders:
* [FK3V](https://github.com/DGWhittaker/Rat-FK3V-files/tree/master/FK3V) contains C code implementing a modified Fenton-Karma model which reproduces rat ventricular APD, along with matplotlib script to compare APD restitution with experimental data
* [Geometry-files](https://github.com/DGWhittaker/Rat-FK3V-files/tree/master/Geometry-files) contains 3D DTI-based geometry and myocyte orientation files in .txt format; alpha and theta are rule-based implementations, whereas MH1, MH3, MH5 correspond to DTI1, DTI2, DTI3, respectively
